# Static Assets

Place your logo image here as `logo.png`.

The logo should be:
- Square format (recommended: 48x48px or larger)
- PNG format with transparency (if needed)
- Named exactly `logo.png`

The app will automatically display it in the sidebar header. If the logo is not found, the app will fall back to showing the text "Math Notes Helper".
