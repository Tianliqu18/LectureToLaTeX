Let $G$ be a group. Let $H \lhd G$ (i.e., $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$).

Let $\phi: G \to G/H$ be the quotient map.

For $g \in G$, we have $\phi(g) = gH$.

Now, let $K \leq G$ be a subgroup.

Then $\phi(K) = \{kH : k \in K\} = KH/H$.

Also, $\ker(\phi|_K) = K \cap H$.

So by the first isomorphism theorem:
\[
K/(K \cap H) \cong KH/H
\]

Now, if $K \leq H$, then $K \cap H = K$ and $KH = H$, so:
\[
K/K \cong H/H \Rightarrow \{1\} \cong \{1\}
\]

If $H \leq K$, then $K \cap H = H$ and $KH = K$, so:
\[
K/H \cong K/H
\]

This is consistent.

Now, consider the case where $K \lhd G$ as well.

Then $KH$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Since $H \lhd G$ and $K \lhd G$, we have $KH = HK$ and $KH \lhd G$.

Then:
\[
G/KH \cong (G/H)/(KH/H)
\]

This is the third isomorphism theorem.

Also, $K \cap H \lhd G$ and:
\[
G/(K \cap H) \cong (G/K) \times (G/H)
\]
if $G = KH$ and $K \cap H = \{1\}$ (direct product).

% Some unclear notation in original OCR
% Possibly discussing specific calculations with group elements

Let $a, b \in G$. Then:
\[
ab = ba? \quad \text{Not necessarily, unless $G$ is abelian}
\]

If $k \in K$, then $\phi(k) = kH$.

Since $K \lhd G$, we have $gkg^{-1} \in K$ for all $g \in G$.

In particular, for $h \in H$, we have $hkh^{-1} \in K$.

But since $H \lhd G$, we also have $khk^{-1} \in H$.

So $K$ and $H$ normalize each other.

Then $[K,H] \leq K \cap H$.

If $K \cap H = \{1\}$, then $[K,H] = \{1\}$, so $K$ and $H$ commute elementwise.

Then $KH \cong K \times H$.

This is a common situation in group theory.
